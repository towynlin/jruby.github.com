# The JRuby Community

JRuby has a large and active community. You can connect up with them in several ways:

[**Blogs**](/blogs) - The JRuby Team, individual team members, and a number of folks from the community blog about JRuby and related topics.

[**Twitter**](/twitter) - There are twitter accounts for The JRuby Team and all the team members.

[**IRC**][irc] - Many members of the JRuby community can be found on IRC, on the FreeNode network in the #jruby channel. Most of the core JRuby developers also communicate on IRC. If you want quick, interactive help or just want to hang out, feel free to stop by!

[**Mailing Lists**][lists] - There are also several mailing lists, for users, developers, and folks interested in tracking the process of JRuby.

[**Bug Tracker**][jira] - Users are encouraged to report any bug, however insignificant it may seem. Please run a couple searches first to see if your bug has been reported, or ask us about it on IRC&nbsp;or the mailing lists.

[**Wiki**][wiki] - The JRuby wiki--user editable.
