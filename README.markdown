This repository contains the content for http://www.jruby.org/ as
[Jekyll][]-generated site.

# Building

The site is generated with Jekyll, and while you can use the regular
`jekyll` executable, the preferred steps are the following:

1. (One time only) Install Bundler (`gem install bundler`) and run
   `gem bundle` once.
2. Run rake to see the available tasks:

        JRuby.org documentation site. Available tasks:
        rake clean     # Clean the site
        rake deploy    # Deploy the files to jruby.org
        rake generate  # Generate the site using Jekyll
        rake server    # Run a file server that serves and regenerates the files

3. `rake server` runs a server with a small Rack shim that emulates
   the Apache configuration on jruby.org, so you can browse the site.
   It also emulates Jekyll's `--auto` mode so that files are refreshed
   as you save changes to them.
